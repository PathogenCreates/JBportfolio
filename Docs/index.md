Hello, I'm Jamie, a cybersecurity major at **[George Mason University](gmu.edu "GMU")**. I'm passionate about protecting digital assets from unauthorized users and malicious attacks.

I have a strong foundation in C# programming, network security, virtualization, digital forensics and server administration. I have completed several courses and projects in these areas, such as creating a VPN, analyzing network traffic and detecting intrusions, and conducting a penetration test with documentation.

My goal is to become a cybersecurity analyst and work for a reputable organization that values information security. I'm interested in learning new technologies and techniques to enhance my cybersecurity skills and knowledge.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games, reading White Wolf RPG books, and listening to music. I'm also a Jehovahs witness, and attend weekly bible studies.
